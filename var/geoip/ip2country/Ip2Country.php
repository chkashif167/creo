<?php

/**
 * This class contains the capability to look up IP addresses and return the correct
 * country, based on the lookup data generated from process_csv.php.
 *
 * Since PHP cannot handle 32-bit unsigned longs, we translate the IP addresses
 * into 4-byte strings instead, which also should safeguard against future IPv6
 * lookups.
 *
 * The index file contains 12-byte records, grouped into three 32-bit dwords. 
 * The first is an IP block address, the second contains the position in the data
 * file, and the third is the block length for that IP group.
 *
 * The data file contains a long list of 6-byte records, the first four form the
 * start of the IP address block and the remaining two bytes the two-letter ISO
 * country code to which that IP block is allocated. 
 *
 * The lookups are done by calculating the "group number" of the IP address,
 * which is the high 13 bits, and looking that up in a hash table. This yields
 * a position into the data file, which can be either preloaded or loaded on
 * demand. The data is then searched using a binary tree search, yielding 
 * effectively O(log2 n) lookups.
 *
 * Memory is used very conservatively - since we only use strings to represent
 * data, a fully preloaded database should add about 1.2 MB of internal memory.
 *
 * On a 2.3 GHz Intel Core i5 we get about 40,000 lookups per second.
